        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to
            commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The
            farmer
            said,
            <em>Maybe</em>. The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
            everybody
            came
            back
            and
            said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said,
            <em>Maybe</em>.
        </p>

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The
            neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, <em>Maybe</em>. The next day the
            conscription
            officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken
            leg.
            Again
            all
            the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <em>Maybe</em>.</p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether
            anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune;
            or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
        not
        make a big deal out of it...
