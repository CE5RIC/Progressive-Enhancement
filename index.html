        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p class="firstparagraph">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of
            his neighbors came
            around
            to
            commiserate. They said,<em class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                unfortunate.”</em>
            The
            farmer
            said,
            <em class="farmer">"Maybe"</em>. The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in
            the evening
            everybody
            came
            back
            and
            said, <em class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
                horses!”</em> The farmer
            again said,
            <em class="farmer">"Maybe"</em>.
        </p>

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The
            neighbors then said, <em class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</em> and the farmer responded, <em
                class="farmer">"Maybe"</em>. The next
            day the
            conscription
            officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken
            leg.
            Again
            all
            the neighbors came around and said, <em class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</em> Again, he said, <em
                class="farmer">"Maybe"</em>.</p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether
            anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune;
            or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
    <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
            class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not
        <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's
        not
        make a big deal out of it...
